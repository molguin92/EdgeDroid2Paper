\section{A model of human behavior for \ac{WCA}}\label{sec:model}

In order to accurately emulate the behavior of a human, a model for \ac{WCA} needs to implement two main behaviors.
One, it needs to generate realistic \emph{execution times} for each step in the task, considering the current and historical impairment of the \ac{WCA} system.
And two, it needs to produce sequences of video frames for each step which mimic what a human generate.

In this section, we present and discuss our approaches to both these challenges.

\subsection{Generating realistic timings}

\input{tables/empirical_exec_times.tex}

In our previous work~\cite{olguinmunoz:impact2021}, we identified four main results concerning the step execution times of humans in \ac{WCA}:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item System slow-down induces additional behavioral slow-down which scales with the decrease in system responsiveness.
    Moreover, users become progressively slower the longer they spend in a degraded system state.

    \item The effects of system slow-down on human behavior remain for a while even after system responsiveness improves.
    
    \item Humans get faster at performing steps as the task progresses. However, this effect is dampened by reduced system responsiveness, even disappearing at higher levels of system impairment.
    
    \item The above effects seem to be modulated by the Big Five~\cite{oliver:bfi1999} trait of \emph{neuroticism}.
\end{enumerate}

Using these insights, we design a generator of realistic execution times for step-based \ac{WCA}.
The generator further builds upon the original data collected for~\cite{olguinmunoz:impact2021}; this data is first preprocessed and then sampled according to a series of rules in order to produce novel,realistic sequences of execution times for a task.
Alternatively, instead of sampling directly from the preprocessed data, a theoretical distribution can be fitted, thus allowing for generation of realistic synthetic execution times.

\subsubsection{Data pre-processing}

A sample of the step timing data obtained for~\cite{olguinmunoz:impact2021} is presented in \cref{tab:exec_times:empirical}.
This data corresponds to real step execution times for \num{40} repetitions, by different human subjects, of the same \num{169}-step task.
During each repetition of the task, system responsiveness was altered in real time by setting the round-trip-times of all frames to a fixed value (corresponding to the \emph{delay} column in \cref{tab:exec_times:empirical}).
For more details on the experimental design and data collection procedure, please see the original article~\cite{olguinmunoz:impact2021}.

We process this data in the following manner:

\input{tables/processed_exec_times.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Normalized neuroticism values are binned into predefined, contiguous bins.
    We use three bins with edges
    \( \left(-\infty, \frac{1}{3}\right) \),
    \( \left[\frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}\right) \),
    and \( \left[\frac{2}{3}, \infty\right) \),
    as these give the most even distribution of number of samples across bins.

    \item System impairment (\emph{delay}) is binned into predefined, contiguous bins.
    Once again, we use three bins giving a somewhat even distribution of samples:
    \( \left(-\infty, 1.0\right) \),
    \( \left[1.0, 2.0\right) \),
    and \( \left[2.0, \infty\right) \) seconds.

    \item A predefined number of steps (by default, \num{8}) immediately after each change in binned impairment are marked according to the relative change in impairment: \emph{low-to-high}, or \emph{high-to-low} impairment.
    We label this value the \emph{transition tag}.
    Steps at the beginning of the task (where there is no previous impairment), or too far away from a transition in impairment, are tagged as \emph{no transition}.

    \item Each step in a sequence tagged with the same transition tag is assigned a sequential \emph{duration} number.
    This value tracks how long the system has been in a specific state, and is in turn binned into three bins:
    \( \left[0, 5\right) \),
    \( \left[5, 10\right) \),
    and \( \left[10, \infty\right) \) steps.

    \item Finally, execution times are shifted by one step.
    This is because the execution time of a step depends on the state of the previous step, and not the current one.
    As explained previously, humans only becomes aware of the responsiveness of the system when they finish a step and have to wait for feedback from the system.
\end{enumerate}
