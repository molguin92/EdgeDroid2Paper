This data is first preprocessed and then sampled according to a series of rules in order to produce novel,realistic sequences of execution times for a task.
Alternatively, instead of sampling directly from the preprocessed data, a theoretical distribution can be fitted, thus allowing for generation of realistic synthetic execution times.

\subsubsection{Data pre-processing}

A sample of the step timing data obtained for~\cite{olguinmunoz:impact2021} is presented in \cref{tab:exec_times:empirical}.
This data corresponds to real step execution times for \num{40} repetitions, by different human subjects, of the same \num{169}-step task.
During each repetition of the task, system responsiveness was altered in real time by setting the round-trip-times of all frames to a fixed value (corresponding to the \emph{delay} column in \cref{tab:exec_times:empirical}).
For more details on the experimental design and data collection procedure, please see the original article~\cite{olguinmunoz:impact2021}.

We process this data in the following manner:

\input{tables/processed_exec_times.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Normalized neuroticism values are binned into predefined, contiguous bins.
    We use three bins with edges
    \( \left(-\infty, \frac{1}{3}\right) \),
    \( \left[\frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}\right) \),
    and \( \left[\frac{2}{3}, \infty\right) \),
    as these give the most even distribution of number of samples across bins.

    \item System impairment (\emph{delay}) is binned into predefined, contiguous bins.
    Once again, we use three bins giving a somewhat even distribution of samples:
    \( \left(-\infty, 1.0\right) \),
    \( \left[1.0, 2.0\right) \),
    and \( \left[2.0, \infty\right) \) seconds.

    \item A predefined number of steps (by default, \num{8}) immediately after each change in binned impairment are marked according to the relative change in impairment: \emph{low-to-high}, or \emph{high-to-low} impairment.
    We label this value the \emph{transition tag}.
    Steps at the beginning of the task (where there is no previous impairment), or too far away from a transition in impairment, are tagged as \emph{no transition}.

    \item Each step in a sequence tagged with the same transition tag is assigned a sequential \emph{duration} number.
    This value tracks how long the system has been in a specific state, and is in turn binned into three bins:
    \( \left[0, 5\right) \),
    \( \left[5, 10\right) \),
    and \( \left[10, \infty\right) \) steps.

    \item Finally, execution times are shifted by one step.
    This is because the execution time of a step depends on the state of the previous step, and not the current one.
    As explained previously, humans only becomes aware of the responsiveness of the system when they finish a step and have to wait for feedback from the system.

The model is provided as a Python~\num{3.10} library which includes \acp{API} for the generation of realistic execution times and synthetic traces of video frames.
