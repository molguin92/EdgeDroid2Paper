\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

The study and benchmarking of \ac{WCA} applications is a challenging discipline due to these application's intrinsic human-in-the-loop nature.
Humans are notoriously unreliable, and greatly complicate the scalability and repeatability of experiments.
Furthermore, recruiting large enough cohorts of humans for large-scale experimentation is both greatly time-consuming and prohibitively expensive for many research groups.
In this paper, we have presented the \edgedroid{} model of human timing behavior for \ac{WCA}
