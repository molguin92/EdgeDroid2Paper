\section{Validation}
\todo[inline]{Discuss: do we really need to "validate"? I remember us settling on not validating since the model is built from data we know (and the verification shows that it follows the behaviors we expect?).

If we want to validate, do we need to execute against a human? Doesn't the paper get too bloated?
