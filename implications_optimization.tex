\section{Implications for the optimization of resource consumption and responsiveness trade-offs in \ac{WCA}}\label{sec:implications:optimization}

As with any application intended for mass deployment on multi-tenant systems such as the edge, \ac{WCA} applications will have to be configured and designed to minimize resource consumption at runtime.
At the same time, imposing too stringent requirements on resource consumption can adversely affect application responsiveness, which in turn has the potential to drastically reduce quality of experience for users.
Optimizing the deployment of these applications thus intrinsically involves achieving a balance between the reduction of resource consumption while maintaining an acceptable level of system responsiveness.

In the following section we will study the optimization of resource consumption-responsiveness trade-offs in two dimensions of \ac{WCA}, number of samples captured per step and energy consumption per step.

\subsection{Optimization framework}

Again, our optimization approaches focus on individual steps.
Thus, we begin by assuming a given execution time distribution \( \mathcal{T} \), and take the modeling and partial solution approach from recents works on energy efficient sampling in edge-based feedback systems.
In \textcite{ICCperiodic1,TMCperiodic}, the authors model the energy in terms of the expected number of samples $\mathbb{E}[\mathcal{S}]$ and the expected wait time $\mathbb{E}[\mathcal{W}]$ experienced by the user.
The authors then find the optimum periodic sampling interval that minimizes this energy, or equivalently the non-constant parts of this energy termed as \textit{Energy Penalty}.

% In this optimization, the constant parts are excluded as it does not affect the process.
With a value much smaller than the execution time of the event, the \ac{RTT} of the final sample is included in this constant part, which is why $\mathcal{W}$ is computed without it.
Next, in \textcite{secAperiodic}, the author retains the model, removes the constraint of periodicity, and finds the optimum aperiodic sampling instants $\{t_n,\,n=1,2,\dots\}$ that minimize the same energy penalty.

In this work, we use the modeling from~\cite{secAperiodic} to find the optimum aperiodic sampling interval.
However, instead of using their two-step approach to find the solution which includes a recursive solution followed by a bisection algorithm, we develop a novel, approximate, but easier solution to finding the set of the optimum aperiodic sampling intervals.
Furthermore, instead of directly optimizing for energy, we start by noting that an objective metric of a variety of optimization problems that are related to sampling, RTT, responsiveness or wait time present themselves 
% in a format similar to that of the energy, 
as a linear combination between $\mathbb{E}[\mathcal{S}]$ and $\mathbb{E}[\mathcal{W}]$ plus terms independent of the number of samples or wait time.
Let $\mathcal{E}$ correspond to such an objective metric.
Thus,
\begin{alignat}{1}
    \Rightarrow\mathcal{E}&=\alpha\mathbb{E}[\mathcal{S}]+\beta\mathbb{E}[\mathcal{W}]+C,\;\label{eq:epsilon_terminal}
\end{alignat}

Optimization business should go into own section.}
Here, $\alpha, \beta$ and $C$ are constants which are responsible for modifying the objective function from one metric to another.
For instance, in the modeling used by \textcite{ICCperiodic1,TMCperiodic,secAperiodic}, the chosen characterization results in a metric which is equal to the energy penalty.
The outline of our solution that minimizes \cref{eq:epsilon_terminal} is provided below with the complete mathematical derivation in \cref{appx1}.

\bigskip

Define an instantaneous sampling rate function $r(t)$ which is related to $\{t_n\}$ such that,
\begin{alignat}{1}
{\int_{t_{n-1}}^{t_n}}r(t)\dif t=1,\;\forall n\geq1.\label{rt}
\end{alignat}
For instance, for periodic sampling, the rate function is a constant equal to the sampling frequency. 
% Using this rate function, we rewrite the expected number of samples as
% \begin{alignat}{1}
% \mathbb{E}[\mathcal{S}]&=\int_{t=0}^{\infty}\bigg(\!\int_{x=0}^{t}\!\!\!\!r(x)\,\mathrm{d}x\bigg)f_{\mathcal{T}}(t)\,\mathrm{d}t,\nonumber
% \end{alignat}
% and the approximate the expected wait time as
% \begin{alignat}{1}
% \mathbb{E}[\mathcal{W}]&=\int_{0}^{\infty}\dfrac{1}{2r(t)}f_\mathcal{T}(t)\,\mathrm{d}t.\nonumber
% \end{alignat}
Now, rewriting \cref{eq:epsilon_terminal} in terms of $r(t)$ and minimizing it gives as an optimum rate function $r^*(t)$ as
\begin{alignat}{1}
r^*(t)&=\sqrt{\dfrac{\beta f_\mathcal{T}(t)}{2\alpha\bar{F}_\mathcal{T}(t)}}.\nonumber\\
\intertext{Thus, for a Rayleigh distributed $\mathcal{T}$ with parameter $\sigma$,}
r^*(t)&=\sqrt{\dfrac{\beta t}{2\alpha\sigma^2}}\nonumber\\
% \Rightarrow &\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}}\!\!\!\sqrt{\dfrac{\beta t}{2\alpha\sigma^2}}\,\mathrm{d}t=1,\;\forall n\geq1\nonumber\tag{from \eqref{rt}}\\
% \Rightarrow &\;t_{n+1}^{\frac{3}{2}}-t_{n}^{\frac{3}{2}}=3\sigma\!\sqrt{\tfrac{\alpha}{2\beta}}\nonumber\\
\Rightarrow t_n&=\Big(3\sigma\!\sqrt{\tfrac{\alpha}{2\beta}}\Big)^{\frac{2}{3}}n^{\frac{2}{3}}\label{tn_approx_rayleigh}
\end{alignat}


\subsection{Optimizing for mean number of samples per step}

We first look at the application of \cref{eq:epsilon_terminal} for the optimization of number of captured samples per step.
We start with this metric as its implications for resource consumption and responsiveness are straightforward to understand.
On the one hand, higher sampling rates directly lead to perceived increased system responsiveness, as smaller sampling intervals translate into smaller maximum wait times.
On the other, the relationship between number of samples captured and sent and network congestion is exponential, and too high sampling rates quickly lead to bottlenecks on the network, particularly in multi-tenant environments.
Additionally, the energy cost of capturing a sample on a \ac{WCA} client device is often much higher than remaining in an idle state, and thus excessive sampling leads to drastically increased energy consumption.
Optimizing the number of samples captured per step can thus be a straightforward way of reducing resource consumption and contention in \ac{WCA} applications.

However, an unconstrained optimization of the number of samples is trivial and meaningless as the solution points to a single sample at $t\!\rightarrow\!\infty$, which also takes the wait time to infinity.
We look at the constrained optimization of the expected number of samples with an upper bound $w_0$ for the expected wait.
That is, $\mathbb{E}[\mathcal{W}]\!\leq\!w_0$. We show in \cref{appx1} that the appropriate $\alpha$ and $\beta$ for this problem satisfies the condition
\begin{alignat}{1}
\frac{\alpha}{\beta}=\frac{2\sqrt{2}\,w_0^2}{(\mathlarger{\Gamma}(\tfrac{3}{4}))^2\,\sigma}\approx1.9\frac{w_0^2}{\sigma},\nonumber
\end{alignat}
where, $\mathlarger{\Gamma}(x)$ is the Gamma function.

\medskip

We introduce here a reference scheme to which we will compare our approach.
In~\cite{Wang2019Towards}, \citeauthor{Wang2019Towards} introduce an adaptive sampling scheme for \ac{WCA} intended to reduce the number of samples processed per step while still meeting application responsiveness bounds.
At every sampling instant \( t \), the scheme adapts the sampling rate \( R(t) \) of the system according to the estimated likelihood of the user having finished the step,
following the formula 

\begin{equation}
    R(t) = R_\text{min} + \alpha\left( R_\text{max} - R_\text{min} \right) * CDF(t)
\end{equation}

\( R_\text{max} \) and \( R_\text{min} \) correspond to the maximum and minimum sampling rates of the system, respectively.
\( R_\text{max} \) can directly be assumed to correspond to \( 1 / \text{\ac{RTT}}_\mu \), where \( \text{\ac{RTT}}_\mu \) corresponds to the mean \ac{RTT} of the system.
\( R_\text{min} \) needs to either be calculated according to the latency bounds of the system or specified manually, and \( \alpha \) corresponds to a scaling factor and \( t \) to the time of the current sampling instant with respect to the start of the step.
Finally, \( CDF \) corresponds to the \ac{CDF} of a distribution describing the execution times for the current step; \citeauthor{Wang2019Towards} used a single static Gaussian distribution for all steps in their work.

In the following, we will show the effects of more accurate execution time estimation using our timing models on the performance of this adaptive scheme.
For this, we implement two variants of the adaptive scheme.
The first one corresponds a reference implementation using \citeauthor{Wang2019Towards}'s original design, using a Gaussian distribution fitted to all the execution times collected for~\cite{olguinmunoz:impact2021} for \ac{CDF} calculation.
This variant the same \ac{CDF} for every step.
The second variant instead uses an embedded internal execution time model to keep track of the \acp{TTF} of the system and adjust the distribution of execution times following the state of the timing model.
In other words, in this variant the \ac{CDF} used for instantaneous calculation of the sampling rate \( R \) changes over time according to the state of the execution time model.
For timing model configurations which do not fit a distribution to execution time data, the \ac{CDF} corresponds to the \ac{ECDF} of the selected execution times.

We proceed to set up an experiment where these sampling scheme variants are deployed on identical, simulated, \num{100}-step tasks.
Also included for reference in this experiment is greedy (also known as \emph{zero-wait}) sampling, where samples are taken as fast as possible; a new sample is taken as soon as the result for the previous one has been received.
This is the default sampling strategy used in most existing \ac{WCA} prototypes.
The execution times for each step are generated by a realistic model parameterized with high neuroticism and without any distribution fitting on the data (this timing model is separate from the internal timing models inside the sampling schemes).
We set \( R_\text{min} \) to \SI{0.5}{\hertz} and \( \alpha \) to \num{3.0}.
The \ac{RTT} of the system is set to one of \SIlist[list-final-separator={, or}]{150;300;600}{\milli\second}, constant for all steps of the task.
For each combination of sampling scheme configuration (original adaptive by \textcite{Wang2019Towards}, adaptive with \edgedroid{} model, greedy) and \ac{RTT}, we run \num{100} repetitions of the task for good statistical significance.

The results of this investigation are presented in \cref{fig:samples}
They clearly show the potentially dramatic effects of more accurate execution time estimation when optimizing sampling rates.
When using the realistic model for execution time estimation, the sampling schemes achieve between \SI{14}{\percent} and \textasciitilde\SI{27}{\percent} better average performance, depending on the \edgedroid{} model parameterization and the system \ac{RTT}.
\todo[inline]{Update with new ground truths.}
This is true even for configurations with low neuroticism which do not exactly match the parameterization of the external timing model driving the execution times for the steps, showing thus the importance of even less-accurate approximations.

\subsection{Optimizing for energy consumption}

Energy consumption is another yet unexplored dimension of \ac{WCA} with great opportunities for optimization.
To explore the potential implications of our realistic model of human timings for energy consumption, we will introduce here a novel scheme for sampling in step-based \ac{WCA} systems.

\subsubsection{Energy minimization}\label{sec:aprxSol_Energy}

With the general solution available, minimizing energy $E$ boils down to finding the appropriate $\alpha$ and $\beta$ that $\mathcal{E}=E$ in \cref{eq:epsilon_terminal}.
For this, we directly take the modeling from~\cite{secAperiodic} with a necessary modification in the assumption of one-way communication in all but the final sample.
With feedback given even to the discarded samples in our model, we have, 
\begin{alignat}{2}
    \mathrm{E}=&\;2\mathcal{S}\tau_cP_c+(\mathcal{T}+\mathcal{W}+\tau_\mathrm{p}+2\tau_\mathrm{c}-2\mathcal{S}\tau_c)P_0\nonumber\\
    % &=s\tau_c(P_c-P_0^{(t)})+wP_0^{(t)}+(\tau+\tau_c+\tau_p) P_0^{(t)}+\tau_cP_c\\
    =&\;2\tau_{\text{c}}(P_{\text{c}} -P_0)\mathcal{S}+\mathcal{W}P_0+(\mathcal{T}+\tau_{\text{p}} +2\tau_{\text{c}}) P_0\nonumber\\
&\Rightarrow \alpha=2\tau_{\text{c}}(P_{\text{c}} -P_0),\text{ and }\beta=P_0.\nonumber
\end{alignat}
